# Rename Script
Example:
A list of MP3 files would be renamed to Song-SomePlaylist.MP3 like that
./Rename.sh ".mp3" "-SomePlayList.mp3"
All songs in current directory with matching file names

this-song.mp3
Album/another-song.mp3
are renamed to

this-song-SomePlayList.mp3
Album/another-song-SomePlayList.mp3
